## This is our practice file

Caroline, you can write something here:
im typing 
i also type a thing


I'm typing something here. another thing. Becca is typing something here.

Rebecca adds a line here.

And another line here.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
I'm going to add a portion here. Does this look good?

What happens if I make a change like this.

Nothing will ever happen.

And then save it but don't upload anything
